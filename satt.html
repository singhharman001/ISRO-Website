            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/computer-network/images/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-satellite-communication2.png" alt="Signal transmission diagram" width="600" height="450" class="image">
            <p>Satellites are marvels of engineering that play a critical role in modern communication, navigation, Earth observation, and scientific research. A satellite functions by orbiting the Earth or another celestial body, using its onboard systems to collect, process, and transmit data. Satellites operate through a combination of advanced communication equipment, sensors, and power systems. Positioned in space after being launched via rockets, their orbits—whether geostationary, polar, or elliptical—are determined based on their purpose.</p>
            <p>A satellite's primary communication role involves transponders, which receive signals from Earth, amplify them, and retransmit them to a target location. This technology is foundational for global broadcasting, internet services, and long-distance telecommunications. Weather satellites monitor atmospheric conditions, while navigation satellites like ISRO's NAVIC provide precise positioning data. Earth observation satellites capture high-resolution images for applications in agriculture, disaster management, and urban planning.</p>
        <p>ISRO’s satellites, such as the GSAT series for communication and the RISAT series for Earth observation, exemplify the diverse capabilities of satellite technology. The INSAT series has revolutionized meteorology and broadcasting in India, while missions like the Mars Orbiter Mission demonstrate ISRO’s interplanetary research achievements.
